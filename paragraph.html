<p>The four seasons are spring, summer, autumn (or fall), and winter. These seasons are defined by distinct weather patterns and changes in nature, occurring in a cyclical pattern throughout the year. They are caused by the Earth's tilt and its orbit around the sun, which causes different hemispheres to receive varying amounts of sunlight at different times of the year.
